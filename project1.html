      These two pieces are the final steps in a project created for a prompt
      called "Ideas In Form". We were to take an idea from 1D (writing/drawing),
      to 2D (web design), to 3D (physical object), to 4D (a piece incorporating
      an element related to time).

      The domain I chose to explore for this series of pieces was graffiti. I
      wanted to repurpose screens placed in public subway stations and use them
      to ask questions rather than exhort people to buy more things. I also felt
      it was important when making these pieces to do no damage to the
      installation site. By not damaging the installation site people would be
      free to ponder the questions being posed, instead of being distracted by
      the damage being done by their installation.

      To create the 3D piece I made three collapsible wooden frames and
      stenciled the words "Is" "This" "Ours" onto them so they would form a
      question when installed on the displays. This was done in the hopes that
      at least a few people passing would question who has the right to use
      public space and for what purposes. For the 4D piece I incorporated time
      by using an arduino, a PIR sensor, and a stepper motor so that the words
      on the frames would recombine into new questions as people passed them by.
