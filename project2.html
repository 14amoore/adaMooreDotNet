  <p class="slim">
		breadBot is a social media bot operating on Twitter. With
		all of the news regarding the manipulation	of the electorate via social
		media I wanted to see just how hard it would be to create my own social media bot.

		breadBot is programmed to tweet about bread once an hour. The data
		was scraped from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_breads">Wikipedia</a>
		page. This data was then converted into a JSON file and loaded onto an amazon
		server along with a JS file that contained the code for the bot itself.
