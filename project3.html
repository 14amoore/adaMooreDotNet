        T.U.P.A. stands for Toolbox for Unsanctioned Public Art. T.U.P.A. is
        composed of a series of pieces. This project was a continuation of work
        I had done within the domain of graffiti. To explore the domain of
        graffiti more fully I felt I needed to create a series of pieces. This
        series would explore the ways in which I could create pieces that would
        grab the attention of the public using one of the five senses. By doing
        this I would begin to create an intellectual toolbox. This toolbox could
        then be used in the creation of more effective public art whether it was
        sanctioned, or unsanctioned.

        The first piece in this series was intended to take advantage of the
        sense of sight. It was installed outside of a popular night club in an
        industrial area of Bushwick. It was made from a bracket I fabricated by
        welding 1/2" steel pipe together to create a frame to support the
        disco-ball and glitter containers. I attached the piece to a street
        light using ratchet straps. Glitter was released by pulling on the rope
        attached to each of the boxes.

        The second piece in this series was intended to take advantage of the
        sense of smell. It was installed taking advantage of scaffolding that is
        common throughout New York. This piece was installed in December. One of
        the smells I most commonly associate with December is that of pine. By
        soaking 1"x1" balsa wood squares in a mixture of silver fir, and cedar
        essential oils I wanted to take full advantage of the time of year and
        the smells associated with it. By using smell as a cue I hoped passers
        by would take a moment to hang an ornament I provided on a mock
        Christmas tree and take a candy cane.
      </p>
      <p class="slim">
        Unfortunately this did not happen. With in 15 minutes of installation
        all of the candy canes were taken. After another two hours all of the
        decorations had been taken as well. I learned a lot from making and
        installing this piece. When installing public art, if it is sanctioned
        or not, weather must be taken into account. I didn't realize that cold
        weather makes smells weaker. Because the air temperature was near
        freezing people passing by were not able to smell the scent I had
        created so the Christmas tree cutout with ornaments and candy canes most
        likely made very little sense. I also learned that any part of an
        installation that is not tied down is very likely to be taken. With all
        of this in mind I turned to making the final piece in this series.

      This piece was designed to take advantage of the auditory sense, as well
      as the ambient energy available in subway stations. Using 1/2" electrical
      conduit pipe and cutting at the proper lengths I made chimes that
      correspond to notes on the musical scale. The chimes were then installed
      near the edge of the subway platform so the energy created by the arriving
      trains would cause them to hit each other.

        mozallowfullscreen
        allowfullscreen
      ></iframe>
    </div>
    <p class="slim">
      As you can see there was not enough energy created by the arriving train.
      Despite the chimes being very light and close to the platform they did not
      strike against each other. Not to be easily defeated I decided to place
      the chimes as close to the platform as I felt safe.

    <p class="slim">
      Again, despite being as close to the arriving train as I felt was safe the
      chimes did not strike against each other. I still would like to explore
      ways to harness the ambient energy created by the New York subway system.
      The first way to do this would be to investigate lighter materials to use
      to make chimes. It would also be interesting to learn how to accurately
      measure the force created by the incoming and outgoing trains.
