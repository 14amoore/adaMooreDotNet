    <h3>So what is a Cookie anyway?</h3>
    <p class="slim">
      Cookie is short for “magic cookie”. “Magic cookies”, and no these do not
      contain any botanical products, predate the Internet as we know it.
      Originally cookies were used by Unix programmers to send small packets of
      data back and forth.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      In June of 1994 cookies were first used for web communications. A
      programmer employed by Netscape Communications named Lou Montulli was
      working on an e-commerce application for MCI, he proposed using cookies as
      a way to store user’s state on their computers. MCI did not want to store
      every user’s state on its own servers because at the time server space was
      very expensive.

    <p class="slim">
      Cookies were the tool that allowed the virtual shopping cart to be
      implemented at a nearly universal scale.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      At the time of their introduction cookies were not widely known to the
      Internet using public. Cookies were accepted by default, and users were
      not notified about them. The general public was not aware of cookies until
      the Financial Times wrote an article about them in 1996.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      Around the same time as the article was published Montulli and others
      working on the Internet Engineering Task Force identified third-party
      cookies as a non-trivial privacy threat and specified that third-parties
      should either be banned, or not enabled by default.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      Unfortunately the cat was already out of the bag. By the time Montulli’s
      group had issued their opinion on the use or third-party cookies,
      advertising companies had already been using them. Furthermore, their
      recommendation was not followed by Netscape or Microsoft Explorer. This
      set the stage for the use of cookies today.
