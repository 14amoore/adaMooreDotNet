      This project is an auditory interpretation of what I believe is actually
      happening on Twitter. It opens a live stream of tweets, and then passes
      each tweet through sentiment analysis. The bird songs are triggered by
      their sentiment analysis score. The sentiment analysis software returns a
      whole integer between -5 and 5, -5 being the most negative and 5 being the
      most positive. There is a unique bird song for each value. A random 10%
      percent of all tweets received are read by one of the five voices native
      to macintosh computers.

      Twitter is fundamentally misleading, Twitter claims to be a place for
      people to have conversations. What makes it misleading is that the
      interactions people are having on twitter bear none of the hallmarks of
      conversation.
    </h2>
    <h2>
      The most obvious difference being that interactions on twitter are not
      oral, they are mediated by the platform and read from screens. The
      interactions are not happening in real time. Tweets can be read and
      replied to years after they are sent out into the world.
    </h2>
    <h2>
      The conversations are not held between discrete parties. A person posting
      a tweet has no idea who will eventually read this tweet, they have even
      less certainty who will respond to it if anyone. The interactions
      happening on twitter are more akin to bird song in the sense that they are
      functional communication rather than conversational communication.

      This project was made using node.js, and the node packages sentiment,
      twit, say, and play-sound.
