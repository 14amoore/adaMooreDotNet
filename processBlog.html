    <h3>Week 1: 5/13</h3>
    <p class="slim">
        The first week of my JS Independent Study will consist of a brief project that includes an editor, a lintor, and a formatter. The editor I chose to use is VS Code, the lintor is eslint, and the formatter is prettier. This project will also use typescript, sass, and pug.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
        As of right now I'm still doing research on typescript, sass, and pug. I'm not sure exactly what it is I'd like to make but I'll work that out soon.
    </p>
