    <h3>Week 0: 8/24</h3>
    <p class="slim">
      Hi there! If you’ve made it all the way here I imagine you know my name,
      mostly because it is also part of the address for this website. If you’ve
      arrived here by tragic mistake my name is Adam Moore. I am in my second,
      and final year acquiring an MFA from the Design and Technology (henceforth
      referred to as D+T) program at Parsons.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      In my previous life I was a menswear designer at an American fashion brand
      that I decline to name. If you must have a hint I will tell you that the
      founder of the brand is from the Bronx, he is also incompetent, but that
      is a story for another time.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      I created this blog to document my process for my Thesis 1 class here at
      D+T. I am very much looking forward to sharing my failures, AND successes
      with anyone who happens to be reading this with any kind of regularity. I
      am interested in sound, color, shamanism, and the internet. I hope I can
      combine these interests in way that is meaningful to me, and entertaining,
      possibly illuminating to an outside audience (YOU! whoever you are).
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      This first post is three questions I cooked up for myself regarding how I
      might begin my Thesis one class. They are as follows:
    </p>
    <p class="slim">1.What does the internet sound like?</p>
    <p class="slim">
      2. How can we use web technologies to create an online publication that
      moves us (we, people, society) away from merely trying to emulate print?
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      3. What possible role can Shamanism play in the digital world?
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      I created two prototypes to explore question one (What does the internet
      sound like?). The <a class="whiLink" href="./proto1.html">first</a> is
      designed for a user to mouse over different colored squares thereby
      activating sounds and color changes. The
      <a class="whiLink" href="./proto2.html">second</a> is designed for the
      user to press a letter key on their keyboard to activate a different note.
      Both of these were tests of how much input can be used to imagine what the
      internet sounds like. There will be many more to come and I’m excited to
      share them with you. Until next time, enjoy yourselves.
    </p>
    <h3>Week 1: 8/27</h3>
    <div class="wrapper">
      <img class="spin" src="./assets/IMG_7389.JPG" width="100%" />
      <img src="./assets/IMG_7390.jpg" width="100%" />
      <img class="spin" src="./assets/IMG_7392.JPG" width="100%" />
    </div>
    <p class="slim">
      The first week of Thesis 1 started with a bang! Or more precisely with a
      storm, a brainstorm that is (there are going to be lots of puns). The
      images above are of the exercise I did in class which was a clustering
      exercise. I started with the question I want to address; What does the
      Internet sound like?. I then proceeded to unleash the catlike agility of
      my mind and come up with a stupefying number of great ideas. JKJKJK I
      struggle with brainstorming. This time was not so different from every
      other time I’ve tried a formal brainstorming activity.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      Well, that’s not quite true. There was one difference, I genuinely tried
      to not put any pressure on myself to come up with “good ideas”. I tried to
      have any idea at all, come one, come all. By doing this I was able to find
      a little bit of creative flow that often eludes me during brainstorming.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      The second exercise I found even more productive. I pretended that I was
      interviewing myself. I let my inner Barbra Walters loose on my internal
      creative monologue. Again, while I was asking myself questions about what
      the internet sounds like I committed to treating myself with respect. No
      matter how I responded I was under no circumstances to ridicule myself, or
      otherwise be unkind. When I committed to questioning myself with only
      goodwill I found the answers I gave were quite productive.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      What emerged from all of this was a clearer perspective on what I am
      interested in and how I might begin to approach it. I found my reasons for
      being interested in what the internet sounds like are not simply to raise
      awareness. I am interested in this topic so the internet can be a more
      fully immersive and interesting place to spend time. I still feel I have a
      long way to go in formulating this idea. I now know I am doing this to
      improve people’s experience of the internet, I need to think about what I
      feel is missing. Right now it seems like the place to start exploring is
      how we are largely unaware of the data that is flowing in and out of our
      computers when we surf the internet.
    </p>
    <div class="one">
      <img id="smaller" class="cent" src="./assets/vennDia.jpg" />
    </div>
    <p class="slim">
      Above is the venn diagram exercise I did at home. The three domains are:
      The sound of the internet, new kinds of magazine, and Internet
      essentialism (what can the internet do that other mediums cannot?). This
      exercise was a good followup to the in class exercises. I also wanted to
      practice brainstorming in my notebook. I won’t always have a lot of space
      and sticky notes to use so I wanted to find a process that would fit
      inside of a notebook I always carry.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      In the coming week I have two primary goals. The first is to explore more
      fully what I would like to address when it comes to understanding what the
      Internet could sound like. The second is two explore at least one other
      area of inquiry that is not part of wondering what the internet sounds
      like. I’m afraid of committing to one idea too soon.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      By the end of the coming week I would like to have a clearer idea of what
      part of the internet I am most interested in trying to sonify and one more
      domain to explore that interests me. To get a clearer idea of what part of
      the internet I would like to focus on giving sound to I need to research
      how data is flowing in and out of a computer when it is being used to
      explore the internet. I need to do more *fun* brainstorming to develop
      another viable domain of interest.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">Talk to you soon.</p>
    <h3>Week 2: 9/3</h3>
    <p class="slim">
      The question I built for myself was “How is an HTML cookie made?”. I asked
      this question because it is one way that could be used to imaginatively
      explore what the internet sounds like. I started the process as I always
      do when trying to create a digital object, with
      <a class="whiLink" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN</a>. It
      turns out the creation of a cookie is very straight forward. They are a
      very old component of the internet, therefor creating them is not too
      difficult.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      All one has to do to create a cookie is type “document.cookie =
      ‘cookie=chocoChip’”. Of course there are many other attributes that can
      and should be given to cookies. Since this was the first part of what I
      imagine to be a much longer exploration of cookies I felt like it was ok
      to start with something very simple. As I learned over the summer it is
      much better to start simple and add complexity.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      After creating two cookies I wanted to see if I could print them to the
      console. This is the first step I, and many other people writing code
      take, to make sure the code is working. After simply loging the cookies to
      the console I then created a button users could click to log the cookies
      to the console.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      The final step I took was to make the button display the cookies to the
      webpage rather than the console. I’ve loaded this experiment
      <a class="whiLink" href="cookies.html">here</a> and I’d love you to play
      with it. The reason I chose to manipulate the DOM as the last piece of
      added complexity is because if I can display the names of the cookies on a
      webpage then I think I can use tone.js to trigger sounds whenever cookies
      are downloaded from a website.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      My plan for research is two pronged. I need to learn more about the
      technical aspects of our interactions with the internet and how to make a
      piece that utilizes sound in a meaningful and beautiful way.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      To learn about the ways in which we interact with the internet and the
      ways it interacts with us I will be using MDN Web Docs. MDN Web Docs were
      created and maintained by Mozilla. They have documentation regarding
      nearly any piece of internet technology and are a great place to start.
      They also give good background history, providing a roadmap for further
      research.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      To learn about art pieces that fuse technology and senses other than sight
      I’ve bought a book that focuses on an art show that focused solely on
      these types of art works. The title of the book is Sensorium. By reading
      what the artists and curators have to say should point me towards other
      sources for research.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      One of the most important things for me to do is to continue making things
      about my research. This will give me frequent deadlines, and help me asses
      the productivity of my research.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      The five people I listed as potential letter recipients are:<br />
      Lou Montulli<br />
      David Moore<br />
      John Roach Bill & Melinda Gates<br />
      John Cage<br />
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      I wrote to Lou Montulli, one of the people instrumental in the creation of
      HTTP Cookies. You can find the letter
      <a class="whiLink" href="tLetter.html">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      I’m happy with the progress I’ve made this week. I began to learn about
      how to access the events happening on the internet that are happening in
      the background. I need to continue researching how these types of events
      work and how to create a program that would be triggered by them.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      For the coming week while continuing the practical type of research I’ve
      been doing I need to begin doing research into sound. I would like to find
      resources that speak about how it affects us emotionally and how we
      process sound in our everyday lives. By the end of the week I would like
      to have found at least three good academic resources for how we react to
      sound physiologically and emotionally. I would like to find at least two
      more resources to explore how sound is thought about in a musical context,
      where the overlap is found with sound and music. Of course I will continue
      to explore and experiment with internet technologies and how they operate
      to find interesting candidates for use in this project.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      To accomplish these goals I plan to use our libraries, and online academic
      resources, especially JStore. JStore is a great resource for finding a lot
      of writing about a topic starting to do more in-depth research based on
      those initial findings.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">Talk to you next week.</p>
    <h3>Week 3: 9/10</h3>
    <p class="slim">
      I feel pretty comfortable with the progress I am making as of right now. I
      am getting a clearer idea of what my process looks like and how to use it
      in productive ways. I also know that I can not think about my thesis
      constantly, I need to put it down for periods of time, if only for a day
      so my thoughts cans arrange themselves. Below is an approximate diagram of
      how my process works.
    </p>
    <div class="one">
      <img id="smaller" src="./assets/process.jpg" />
    </div>
    <p class="slim">
      The timeline for this project is done, and I have large and small
      milestones that I know I need to get to. I already have my overarching
      question: “What does the Internet sound like?”. I have a good
      understanding of the motivation and methodology I’m going to use to
      explore this question.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      Now that my question and methodology are fairly clear I am able to start
      really examining who my audience is. This week I will be settling on the
      two-three groups I see making up my audience. Once I have a very clear
      idea of who my audience is I will be able to think about the impact I want
      my thesis to have on them. Right now the very fuzzy definition of the
      groups I’m working for are internet users who are rather uncomfortable
      thinking about the underlying technology of the internet. The other group
      are the people who are making the ad tech devices that are surveilling
      internet users. I feel like there’s probably another audience group
      lurking on the periphery of my mind, this we’ll I figure out who that is.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      I will conduct at least one interview with a person I think of as an
      audience member to get a better idea of how they understand the internet
      and how it works. By doing these interviews it will help me understand how
      to make a piece that will be impactful. Even when making something that is
      more artistic I think it’s a great idea to get input from potential
      audience members.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      I collected quite a few pieces of writing that will inform my thinking
      about this project. A book called Sensorium will help inform my aesthetic
      questions, while Invisible Labor will give me an theoretical foundation
      for why it is important for people to know they are doing free labor for
      ad tech companies. I’ve requested two more titles for the library that I’m
      waiting to receive. These titles cover sound and how it affects humans
      psychologically.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      In the coming week I need to read through what I’ve collected and let it
      inform what I’m making. I will make a few more casual prototypes based on
      this reading and testing them with some of my class mates on D12. I’m also
      going to continuing learning about javascript cookies and who they are
      made/used.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      Until next week enjoy this last little bit of summer!
    </p>
    <h3>Week 4: 9/17</h3>
    <p class="slim">
      Ok, first the boring stuff. I was able to get quite a bit done this week.
      I’ve been able to gather a lot of research on my topic. Naturally I’m not
      done researching but I certainly have enough material to read for the next
      few weeks, and enough to support writing the paper and presentation that
      are due as part of my midterms.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      The research I’ve gathered is as follows: Invisible Labor by Marion Crain
      et al., The Sonification Handbook by Thomas Hermann et al., Rorschach
      Audio by Joe Banks, Sensorium edited by Caroline A. Jones, How Music Works
      by David Byrne, and Psychoacoustics: An Introduction by Paul Oomen. I
      would still like to gather more, but since there are other things I have
      to do I feel comfortable working through what I’ve got before diving
      deeper.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      I’ve also got two of the three Precedents I need. The first is Ingrid
      Burington’s writing about the infrastructure of the Internet for the
      Atlantic. The second is “Internet Machine” by Timo Arnall. I’m looking for
      one good precedent within the sound art field and I will have found it by
      the end of this week.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      I have two prototypes made and the final artifact I’m making as part of my
      midterm deliverables will not be another prototype. It will be a series of
      interviews with one person from each of the three groups I see as being my
      audience. What I need to do this week is come up with 8-10 good questions
      to ask. I would like to use the same questions for all three groups so I
      can get a better idea of what each of these groups could potentially get
      from this piece.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      Based on the answers I receive I will adjust my approach to this project.
      At the moment I see it taking shape as a browser extension. This way it
      will be accessible to the broadest possible group of users.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      I have a pretty clear idea of who the audience is for this piece. I see
      the audience as being composed of three distinct groups, non-technical
      users of the internet, technical users of the internet/those who work for
      tech companies, and other artists in the sound art field. I want each of
      these groups to take different things away from my piece.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      I primarily want non-technical users of the internet to understand that
      the there is much more going on underneath the surface of the internet
      than they are led to believe. Whenever they are using the Internet they
      are performing labor on behalf of the entities who are using the data
      transmitted to generate revenue.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      I want them to consider whether or not the services they get from these
      companies is worth surrendering so much of their personal data. I think
      when people are less aware of exactly how much data is collected about
      them it is easy for them to think that google’s search capabilities are a
      fair trade. When people find out how much money google makes using their
      data I believe many of them would re-evaluate how equitable this
      arrangement is. Google is also just one example, and they are certainly
      not even the most egregious offender.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      If people realize how valuable their personal data is to the ad tech
      industry I would hope they would start to ask for a more equitable
      arrangement. To be perfectly clear I do not consider the ad tech industry
      evil. I think it is mostly comprised of people who just need a job like
      the rest of us. I do believe it is an industry ripe for reform. This
      reform can only happen if ordinary Internet users are aware of just how
      valuable they are to the industry.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      I also want non-technical users to gain a better understanding of how the
      Internet actually works. I think many people in this group think of their
      browser as a kind of window into the Internet. Because they think of it as
      a window they do not realize that a lot is happening to give them this
      experience. Their computer is less like a window into another world and
      more like a car. If people had a better understanding of what was actually
      going on when they use the Internet they would use it in a manner that was
      both safer and more equitable for them.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      The second audience I see for my piece, which I will simply call Insiders
      for brevity’s sake, I want to hear how much their industry as a whole is
      taking advantage of the very people that are responsible for it
      flourishing. If users were to hold ad tech, and the tech industry in
      general, more accountable for their actions what would the industry look
      like? I imagine it would be a very different place.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      The third audience for this piece is other artists working in the sound
      space. This type of art is becoming more and more popular and I would
      certainly like to engage with this group when I leave school. This project
      will be a great way to start to engage with this section of the artistic
      community.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      This brings me to the more specific question I’ve been formulating for
      this project. My original question “What does the Internet sound like?” is
      still a great guiding question but certainly not specific enough for a
      thesis project that is supposed to be completed over the course of an
      academic year.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      With this project I am interested in focusing on “Why can’t we hear the
      background operations of the Internet? If we could hear some of these
      operations would our experience of the Internet change?”. My original
      question is a nice tag line to get people’s attention and this more
      specific question is getting close to a thesis statement for the paper I
      will be writing. Taken together I think I’m very close to having a final
      version of my question.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      We were asked to write an exploratory first draft of our essay. Here is s
      <a class="whiLink" href="essayDraft.html">link</a> to a mine.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      Just to recap for my own sanity, by the end of this week I need to have
      one more precedent. This one from the sound art field. My interview
      questions, and emails sent to people I would like to interview asking,
      nay, pleading, for their time.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      Sorry this was so long. I hope you enjoyed my wall of words.
    </p>
    <h3>Week 5: 9/24</h3>
    <p class="slim">
      This week I gathered more research resources that are going to be very
      helpful in articulating my ideas to a wider audience. “An acoustemology of
      streaming media and information communication technologies” by Christian
      Benvenuti, and “Breaking out: The trip back” by Helen Thorington were
      truly wonderful things to find.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      I was struggling to find research that helped me articulate why I felt
      sound art, and our aural experience of the world are important. Much more
      important than most people think they are. This feeling that our primary
      way for experiencing the world is through our sense of sight makes sense
      intuitively. Personally the sonic landscape of a place, has always been at
      least as important as how it appears visually to me. Unfortunately I
      cannot produce a thesis based only on my feelings.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      That is why the following quote from Acoustemology was such a great find.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      “Apprehending the world through the faculty of hearing means that sound
      ‘is central to making sense, to knowing, to experiential truth’, and that
      ‘the experience of place potentially can always be grounded in an acoustic
      dimension’. In Feld’s acoustemology, emplacement - place as sensed or
      sensation - implies a deep connection between sound and space in
      perceiving.”
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      This quote concisely articulates many of the feelings I have long had
      about sound and how I use my sense of hearing to navigate the world. It
      also confirms that my use of sound to make sense of the world is not
      exclusive to me and can be used to help others gain a better understanding
      of the Internet.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      One of the primary goals of thinking about what the Internet sounds like
      is helping people understand the Internet is a place. As I started to
      articulate last week, when we are using the Internet there is an allusion
      that because the visuals of the internet are behind our computer screen we
      are merely observing the Internet, not with in it.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      By giving sound to the background operations of the internet this will
      help people understand whenever people are interacting with the Internet
      they are within the Internet, not safely behind their screen. The screen
      is simply acting in a manner akin to that of a car’s windshield, it allows
      people to visually interact with the physical place they are traveling
      through.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      The second piece of writing, “Breaking Out: The Trip Back”, will help me
      ground my piece within the larger context of sound art that uses the
      Internet to create the work. This helped me to find the third precedent
      that I needed, as well as understand how my piece might be understood by
      those with in the sound art world.

      The piece Simultaneous Translation by John Roach and Willy Whip is a great
      precedent for me to use because it uses features of the Internet, often
      thought of as inconveniences, as a way to determine the final shape of the
      piece. Much the same way I am proposing to use cookies, and people’s
      actions on the Internet to create the piece.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      I completed the first of three interviews I am conducting as my third
      artifact to present as part of midterms. I interviewed a former Professor
      and Friend Michelle Nahum-Albright. She falls into the non-technical user
      audience. I asked her the following questions:
    </p>
    <ul class="slim">
      <li>How often do you use the Internet?</li>
      <li>What is your primary device for browsing the Internet?</li>
      <li>
        How would you describe what happens when you type a web address into a
        browser’s search bar?
      </li>
      <li>What browser do you use?</li>
      <li>Did you choose that browser?</li>
      <li>Are you familiar with HTML, CSS, & JS?</li>
      <li>Can you tell me roughly how each one works?</li>
      <li>Can you tell me what internet cookies are?</li>
      <li>
        Do you know that you can see all of the cookies installed on your
        computer?
      </li>
      <li>What web services do you regularly use that are free?</li>
      <li>Can you tell me how these companies make money?</li>
      <li>
        Knowing how these companies make money do you consider their services
        free?
      </li>
      <li>How would you describe what your are doing for these companies?</li>
      <li>Are you familiar with the concept of invisible labor?</li>
      <li>What senses do you use to navigate the world?</li>
      <li>Of your senses what do you associate with the Internet and why?</li>
      <li>
        When you are traveling and wake up in a new place will you tell me what
        senses you use to figure out where you are?
      </li>
      <li>How might you use other senses to interact with the Internet?</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="slim">
      Her answers to all of these questions were very informative for me. They
      confirm what I am doing, and proposing to make would help her to be aware
      of what is going on when she browses the Internet and to think of the
      Internet as a place. Michelle knew cookies were used to track her around
      the Internet and they are how companies like Google make much of their
      money. She was unfamiliar with the idea of invisible labor. When it was
      briefly explained to her she felt that she was doing labor on behalf of
      tech companies and what she was getting in return was probably not a fair
      exchange.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      She did bring up a great point about the fact that it is entirely possible
      that all of the people who might interact with my piece will use it for
      long periods of time. I absolutely agree with her. Luckily I don’t think
      people need to interact with this piece for long periods of time to get
      something out of it. Still, I would like at least some people to make this
      piece a part of their everyday browsing. I think user testing will help me
      solve this problem.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      I’m really looking forward to the next two interviews I have scheduled.
      One is with a person who works for one of the large tech companies, and
      another is with John Roach. Because he created one of the piece that I’m
      using as a precedent the conversation should be very interesting indeed.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      This week I will be focusing on the two interviews I have scheduled as
      well as working on drafts of my essay and presentation that are due for
      midterm. I think I have gathered everything I need to make a strong
      presentation and paper. Now it’s up to me to put everything together in a
      way that is compelling and concise.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      Talk to you post midterms. In the meantime, go to pumpkin patch, have a
      apple cider donut, get your autumn on.
    </p>
    <h3>Week 6: 10/1</h3>
    <p class="slim">
      This week I finished interviewing members of my prospective audience, made
      the first draft of my presentation, and continued editing the paper due as
      part of my Midterm. The two interviews were certainly the most exciting
      things I completed this week. I interviewed a sound artist, and a person
      who currently works for Microsoft.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      I asked these people the same series of questions that I asked my first
      interviewee. After speaking with Lara about my interviews she helped me
      see that these questions were grouped into three general themes.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      The first theme was to find out how much each interviewee knew about the
      Internet and its infrastructure. The second section was getting at how
      they feel about having money made from the data that is siphoned off of
      them whenever they are using the Internet. The final section of questions
      was to help me understand how they use their senses in their everyday life
      and how they would like to use their senses to interact with the Internet.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      It was quite striking how similar the answers were from each of the three
      interviews. They all were familiar with the technologies that are the
      backbone of the Internet. They all knew what cookies are, furthermore if
      it were easier for them to find the cookies installed on their computer
      they would do so. They are curious about what’s being installed but it’s
      not top of mind for them because they aren’t going to the Internet to see
      who’s surveilling them, they’re going to the Internet to do any number of
      small things, shop, research, read, email, etc.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      They all said that they would like to be more aware of what is happening
      to their computer while they are using the Internet but if they have to go
      looking for this information they’re just too busy to look on their own.
      This is something I understand and it’s one of the primary motivations for
      making this piece. People shouldn’t have to search for the information,
      and likely the individual cookies aren’t important it’s the cumulative
      effect of having so many installed and sending data to so many different
      place is what’s important. It’s about the sheer scale of what’s going on.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      I also finished the first draft of my midterm presentation this week. I
      presented it to my class on Tuesday and it went well. It was a first
      draft. All of the tasks I needed to complete for Midterms is done. Now I
      need to make the presentation more conversational and less about ticking
      the boxes of what the guest crits are supposed to hear.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      I’m happy with what I’ve accomplished this week. Interviewing people from
      each of my three audiences for this piece was very helpful to me. I now
      know that the groups of people I am making this for would take away the
      information that I want them to take away. My message is calibrated
      properly for the audience. This does not mean that I am going to stop
      working with audience members. It will continue to be crucial for me to
      work with my audience to know how they feel about what I’m making.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      I also need to start thinking about how I want my piece to sound. I don’t
      want it to sound ominous, or jarring, at least at the beginning. I think
      the best fields for me to explore would be sounds that are close to white
      noise, and aren’t necessarily notes in the western music scale. I want it
      to sound more like wind passing over a car, or your ears while riding a
      bike. The first thing I want the audience to feel when they hear these
      sounds is something like wind, or air passing over their ears while moving
      through space.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      My goals for the upcoming week are to finish the presentation, finish the
      paper, and think about the questions I would like to ask of the guest
      crits.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      I need to do another draft, or two of my midterm presentation. I don’t
      want to have many words, if any, on my slides. I think I want them to be
      almost purely visual, most likely GIFS so it is engaging for the audience
      and impactful. The trick will be finding the right images for each slide.
      This will also allow me to make the presentation more of a narrative, and
      more interesting to everyone.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      I’m happy with the drafts of the paper I’ve produced thus far. The changes
      I need to make for it to be ready to turn in for midterm are not daunting
      in anyway. They mostly have to do with my integrating the research I’ve
      done since I finished the last draft.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      Formulating the questions I want the guest crits is where I have the most
      work to do. I’ll be able to come up with the best questions after I’ve
      made the final version of my presentation. At that point I’ll have a firm
      grasp on the narrative I’m presenting and what questions I would like help
      with to take it into the home stretch of this semester.

    <h3>Midterm Critique Reflection: “I find this pretty underwhelming.”</h3>
    <p class="slim">
      I was really looking forward to hearing about what members of the faculty
      thought of sonifying cookies so people would think of the Internet as a
      place. That didn’t really happen. It was still a very good experience for
      me, just slightly disappointing.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      Thus far I’ve gotten very good feedback from the people I’ve talked to
      about what I’m planning to make, and why I want to make it. They have been
      from a wide cross-section of my acquaintances, from people who have known
      me for over a decade to people who I’ve met during my time at D+T.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      All of them have been quite positive, especially people who are interested
      in sound. Until midterm I had not spoken about what I propose to make to
      people who are highly visual. The two members of the faculty who were my
      guest crits are very visual people. Ironically they could benefit from
      thinking of the Internet as a place rather than purely visual event.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      The most useful part of the 25 minute conversation we had was that I
      should make a prototype quickly and see if what I’m thinking is valid.
      Naturally this is something I want to do sooner rather than later, but not
      because I want to know if my idea is viable or not. I know my idea is
      viable. I want to test with people so I can start to think about how the
      sounds of the piece will be composed.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      This is what the two crits missed. Because they’re so visual, they ignored
      everything about music, and sound, that are not readily visible.
      Unfortunately all sounds are invisible, so they weren’t able to help. They
      really just wanted me to add visual elements so I could make it more
      understandable. One of the main premises of what I’ve been thinking, and
      writing about is how we depend too much on our sense of sight in
      navigating the Internet and we need to bring more senses to bear on the
      experience. So I won’t be adding any visual components.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      I will start thinking about how I can bring other senses into the mix,
      haptic feedback would be a very interesting aspect to explore. But, an
      exploration of haptic feedback will only happen after I’m able to get a
      basic version of the browser extension working.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      Anyway, I don’t have too much more to say. The guest crits weren’t very
      useful, and if we’re going to be honest with each other I was pretty
      underwhelmed with them too.
    </p>
    <h3>7 in 7: Documentation and Reflection</h3>
    <h4>Day 1:</h4>
    <p class="slim">
      This first proto was to address the primary concern of one of my guest
      critics, he did not believe that sound was something that could create a
      sense of space or enhance people’s experience of the internet. I used a
      program called sonic pi to create a series of ambient sounds.
    </p>
    <figure class="slim">
      <figcaption>Press play to hear them</figcaption>
      <audio controls src="./assets/day1sound.m4a"></audio>
    </figure>
    <p class="slim">
      I then tested these sounds with six different people. The way I did this
      was very simple. I asked them to wear headphone attached to my computer
      while they surfed the Internet as they usually do. As they browsed I
      watched them and activated a new layer of sound every time they navigated
      to another website. Below is a picture of how I set this up.
    </p>
    <div class="one">
      <img id="smaller" class="cent" src="./assets/t17in71-01.jpg" />
    </div>
    <p class="slim">
      I did this to mimic the sound building every time new cookies were
      installed on their computer. Cookies are downloaded to computers when a
      new site is opened, therefore the sound would build only while a new
      website is in the process of being loaded.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      I asked each of the people kind enough to test this prototype to listen to
      pay attention to how they felt while listening to the sounds. At the end
      of the experience I asked them to tell me a little about their experience.
      Four of the five participants felt the sound was very effective at
      establishing a sense of space.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      All six of the participants felt in different ways more engaged with their
      browsing experience. They were more aware that their browsing would cause
      other events to happen, which is what this project is going for. They all
      also had other good ideas about how this project can be improved. One of
      my favorites is attaching some kind of sound to whenever the mouse is
      pressed.
    </p>
    <h4>Day 2:</h4>
    <p class="slim">
      Day 2 was a much more solitary endeavor. I had never made a browser
      extension before. So the goal was to merely make a “Hello World” browser
      extension. I was able to fire one up in a few hours. You can download it
      <a class="whiLink" href="https://github.com/14amoore/t17in72">here,</a>
      and install it on your computer.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      To install any of these extensions on your computer go to
      <a class="whiLink" href="chrome://extensions">chrome://extensions</a> in
      your browser. Check the box next to Developer Mode. Then click load
      unpacked extension, and select the directory where you downloaded the
      extension to. Then you should see the extension to the right of the
      address bar in chrome.
    </p>
    <h4>Day 3:</h4>
    <p class="slim">
      More extensions! I’ve learned to build projects in a methodical way. On
      Day 2 I made a very basic browser extension and today was the day to add
      some complication. This extension allows users to change the background
      color of my portfolio site one of four colors. It can be downloaded
      <a class="whiLink" href="https://github.com/14amoore/t17in73">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      This was a good introduction on how to use JS in a browser extension. The
      syntax is slightly different because I’m not manipulating on the document,
      but also the browser itself which is very interesting.
    </p>
    <h4>Day 4:</h4>
    <p class="slim">
      Today was a little higher stakes than Days 2 and 3. Today I wanted to find
      out if I could make an extension that would detect all of the cookies
      installed on a user’s browser. After a few hours of reading, and playing
      with different approaches I was able to use some code I found in the
      chrome documentation to do just that.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      This extension looks at all of the cookies stored on the user’s chrome
      browser. All of the cookies are then displayed in a new tab, and the user
      has the option to delete individual cookies, or all of them. This
      extension can be downloaded
      <a class="whiLink" href="https://github.com/14amoore/t17in74">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h4>Day 5:</h4>
    <p class="slim">
      For the last few days I’d been thinking there needed to be some kind of
      educational aspect to this piece. To help people who might download and
      use my Thesis understand why I felt it was important to make it. Today was
      about seeing how to make a function that would redirect to a new tab with
      a brief explanation of the history of cookies.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      This is aspect of the project is far from finished but it was important
      for me to make it as a way to add a new aspect. It was also good to start
      thinking about my Thesis as an experience that would give people back some
      of their agency when navigating the Internet. You can download this
      extension
      <a class="whiLink" href="https://github.com/14amoore/t17in75">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h4>Day 6:</h4>
    <p class="slim">
      I stepped back from extensions for today. I wanted to experiment with Tone
      js. I felt it was a good time to see if the Tone js was capable of making
      the more ambient noises I had used when making the first prototype. Tone
      js is exceptionally robust.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      While reading through the documentation, which you can read here, I found
      their noise generator options. Since I used white noise in my Day 1 proto
      I thought it would be fun to see how the noise generators in Tone js work.
      Here’s a <a class="whiLink" href="7in76.html">link</a> to what I made.
      It’s three different noise generators, white, brown, and pink noise. You
      can toggle them on and off.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      This proto was very exciting because I now know that the sound library
      I’ve chosen can actually make the sounds that I think I want to use!
    </p>
    <h4>Day 7:</h4>
    <p class="slim">
      The final proto was a way for me to combine the different things I’ve been
      working on all week. I made an extension that uses Tone js to turn on and
      off a pink noise generator! I know this probably seems quite basic, but by
      building this I now know that all of the pieces that need to be built for
      my piece to work are possible.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      Before this week I had no idea how to even build an extension. You can
      download this one
      <a class="whiLink" href="https://github.com/14amoore/t17in77">here</a>. It
      can be quite loud so if you decide to use it turn down your volume.
    </p>
    <h4>A little reflection:</h4>
    <p class="slim">
      7 in 7’s are alway exhausting. But the hardest part for me is to make
      something everyday. Around day 5 my brain doesn’t feel as fresh and I stop
      feeling like I have any good ideas. What I learn every time is that what I
      think of as good and bad ideas don’t matter, it is important just to make.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      As long as I keep making I keep learning. Usually the days when I think
      the work will go quickly are the days that take the longest.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      This 7 in 7 was no exception. I was able to make something everyday,
      sometimes even multiple things, and I just picked what I liked best to
      post here.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      I learned my Thesis is a completely viable idea, although I wasn’t really
      worried about that. I learned how to make extensions, lots of them. I also
      learned that the JS tool I chose, Tone JS, sounds like it will also be up
      to the tasks I have planned for it.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      I still have quite a bit of research ahead of me on the history of
      cookies, and how they are used today. This is so I can make a proper
      educational experience for the people are going to be using this piece.
      Overall I am optimistic about this project and can’t wait to get feedback
      from my classmates.
    </p>
    <h3>Week 10:</h3>
    <p class="slim">
      I felt quite productive this week. I had my Frankenstein moment! I linked
      the amount of cookies installed on my computer with Tone JS and created
      sound. This was naturally very exciting to me. Since then I’ve been
      exploring the various properties of cookies.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      I think I will be using the various parameters assigned to cookies to
      begin thinking about how to compose the sound piece I want to generate.
      There are eleven properties that cookies have. They are: name, value,
      domain, hostOnly, path, secure, httpOnly, sameSite, session,
      expirationDate, and storeId. I still need to do some more research on
      exactly what some of these parameters mean, specifically url and domain.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      I do know what session, and secure mean. Session cookies are cookies
      designed to keep users logged into websites, and track their state on
      those websites. Secure cookies are actually quite misleading. Secure does
      not mean the cookies are secure in nature, it only means the cookie is
      marked as secure. Essentially there is no oversight for the use of this
      feature. The expiration date of cookies is another property of cookies
      that should provide a lot of potential for creating a rich soundscape.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">That's it for this week. Let's start making some sound.</p>
