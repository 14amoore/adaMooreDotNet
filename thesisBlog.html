    <h3>Post 1: 8/24</h3>
    <p class="slim">
      Hi there! If you’ve made it all the way here I imagine you know my name,
      mostly because it is also part of the address for this website. If you’ve
      arrived here by tragic mistake my name is Adam Moore. I am in my second,
      and final year acquiring an MFA from the Design and Technology (henceforth
      referred to as D+T) program at Parsons.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      In my previous life I was a menswear designer at an American fashion brand
      that I decline to name. If you must have a hint I will tell you that the
      founder of the brand is from the Bronx, he is also incompetent, but that
      is a story for another time.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      I created this blog to document my process for my Thesis 1 class here at
      D+T. I am very much looking forward to sharing my failures, AND successes
      with anyone who happens to be reading this with any kind of regularity. I
      am interested in sound, color, shamanism, and the internet. I hope I can
      combine these interests in way that is meaningful to me, and entertaining,
      possibly illuminating to an outside audience (YOU! whoever you are).
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      This first post is three questions I cooked up for myself regarding how I
      might begin my Thesis one class. They are as follows:
    </p>
    <p class="slim">1.What does the internet sound like?</p>
    <p class="slim">
      2. How can we use web technologies to create an online publication that
      moves us (we, people, society) away from merely trying to emulate print?
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      3. What possible role can Shamanism play in the digital world?
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      I created two prototypes to explore question one (What does the internet
      sound like?). The <a href="./proto1.html">first</a> is designed for a user
      to mouse over different colored squares thereby activating sounds and
      color changes. The <a href="./proto2.html">second</a> is designed for the
      user to press a letter key on their keyboard to activate a different note.
      Both of these were tests of how much input can be used to imagine what the
      internet sounds like. There will be many more to come and I’m excited to
      share them with you. Until next time, enjoy yourselves.
