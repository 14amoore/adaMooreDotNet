    <h2>Overview:</h2>
    <h2>
      My partner works in the food and drink industry, because of this we are
      lucky enough to have an ever expanding wine collection. Wine is best
      stored in a cool, dark place. The area in our apartment best fitting that
      description is a small coat closet. While a coat closet is dark, and cool
      enough, it does not lend itself to easy examination of our inventory. To
      see what is in the back of the closet we have to unload everything,
      because of this we often forget what exactly is living back there.
    </h2>
    <h2>
      Closet Cav is a full stack web app, using node.js, reach router, firebase
      as the database, react.js and react bootstrap for the front-end. Users are
      authenticated using email and password. I chose firebase because it is a
      realtime database that my partner and I can access at the same time, when
      one of us adds or deletes a bottle the other sees these changes happen
      immediately. I chose react and react bootstrap due to their functionality,
      and popularity within the front-end development industry.
    </h2>
    <h2>The Problem:</h2>
    <h2>
      Closet Cav was developed to show us what wine is currently in our coat
      closet by simply looking at our phones or computers. We needed to be able
      to enter and delete wines from inventory, and search for wines based on
      color, or country of origin.
    </h2>
    <h2>
      This app was created for the use my partner and I, and also as a proof of
      concept project to be shown to other members of the food and drink
      industry for further UX research.
    </h2>
    <h2>Process:</h2>
    <h2>
      This project started out with a simple complaint. ‚ÄúWhy is it that I never
      know exactly what‚Äôs in the back of the closet?‚Äù I know this is a complaint
      similar to that of many small children. While children are haunted by the
      specter of creatures lurking in the dark, my partner was annoyed at not
      knowing what delicious bottle of wine might be forgotten in the dark. This
      complaint was the perfect opportunity to make a full stack web app that
      could answer this question in a simple and user friendly way.
    </h2>
    <h2>
      I chose react.js because of its great functionality and overwhelming
      popularity. I‚Äôve always coded all of the css for my projects with either
      SCSS, or vanilla CSS. Bootstrap is a tool I‚Äôve heard a lot about and this
      seemed like an ideal opportunity to try it out. I chose firebase as the
      database for this project because of it‚Äôs ability to act as a realtime
      database, there‚Äôs no need for me to refresh the page for the inventory to
      update. As someone who is relatively new to databases it was also
      important for me to choose something that was slightly more user friendly
      than tools like mongoDB. The routing is handled by reach router, and the
      backend is handled by node.js.
    </h2>
    <h2>
      After settling on the tech stack, my partner and I spoke about the
      features she would like. At its most basic I knew it would be a C.R.U.D.
      (create, read, update, delete) app. I found that wine is a little more
      complicated than your average blog, or reminder app, there is a lot of
      information about wine that needs to be entered into any inventory. This
      is because of how sprawling and complicated the wine world can be. After
      much talk about the aspects of wine she found most pertinent we settled on
      color, country of origin, producer, grape varietal(s), and vintage as the
      most important information.
    </h2>
    <h2>
      The next challenge to tackle was how the information was to be entered. I
      chose dropdown menus for color, and country of origin. I chose to give
      users a predetermined set of options for color and country because those
      options are the most limited and it made the process of adding wines to
      the app faster and more accurate. With options there‚Äôs no need to worry
      about spelling. The three other pieces of information, producer name,
      varietals, and vintage must be typed in by the user.
    </h2>
    <h2>
      There are thousands of producers in France alone, grape varietals are
      equally numerous so it made sense to ask the user to type this information
      in. Some wines, mainly fortified wines, do not have a specific vintage
      printed on their bottle, users must either enter a four digit number or
      nothing at all. If the user attempts to enter something other than a four
      digit number an error message is displayed. You can see the final UI
      below.

    <h2>Outcomes and Lessons:</h2>
    <h2>
      For the two of us this app works very well. Now, when we‚Äôre deciding what
      to open we know exactly what our options are, most importantly we don‚Äôt
      need to unpack the whole closet. In a field as large as wine there is a
      lot of information people feel is important to include when creating an
      inventory of their collection. The most important piece of information I
      did not include in this iteration was region, and sub-region for each of
      the countries. Regions and sub-regions are most important in well known
      wine producing countries like Italy, France, and the USA.
    </h2>
    <h2>
      After showing this app to people who work across the spectrum of the food
      and beverage industry they had a lot of suggestions for improvement I
      would like to incorporate. The top three being, a favorites list,
      conditionally rendered input sections for regions and sub-regions, and a
      way to add more than one bottle at a time.
    </h2>
    <h2>
      Conditional rendering is one of the great advantages of front-end
      frameworks like react. A favorites list is a great way for users to keep
      track of what they like, and the ability to add more than one bottle when
      entering wine would be very useful for people who tend to buy multiple
      bottles from the same vintage.
    </h2>
    <h2>
      I'm going to keep researching and working on this project because of the
      positive feedback I've gotten from the people I've shown this too. I've
      even had some people ask me to create an account for their own use! You
      can click the link at the top of the page to have a look for yourself.

      collection.
