    <h3>Week 0: 8/24</h3>
    <p class="slim">
      Hi there! If you’ve made it all the way here I imagine you know my name,
      mostly because it is also part of the address for this website. If you’ve
      arrived here by tragic mistake my name is Adam Moore. I am in my second,
      and final year acquiring an MFA from the Design and Technology (henceforth
      referred to as D+T) program at Parsons.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      In my previous life I was a menswear designer at an American fashion brand
      that I decline to name. If you must have a hint I will tell you that the
      founder of the brand is from the Bronx, he is also incompetent, but that
      is a story for another time.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      I created this blog to document my process for my Thesis 1 class here at
      D+T. I am very much looking forward to sharing my failures, AND successes
      with anyone who happens to be reading this with any kind of regularity. I
      am interested in sound, color, shamanism, and the internet. I hope I can
      combine these interests in way that is meaningful to me, and entertaining,
      possibly illuminating to an outside audience (YOU! whoever you are).
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      This first post is three questions I cooked up for myself regarding how I
      might begin my Thesis one class. They are as follows:
    </p>
    <p class="slim">1.What does the internet sound like?</p>
    <p class="slim">
      2. How can we use web technologies to create an online publication that
      moves us (we, people, society) away from merely trying to emulate print?
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      3. What possible role can Shamanism play in the digital world?
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      I created two prototypes to explore question one (What does the internet
      sound like?). The <a class="whiLink" href="./proto1.html">first</a> is
      designed for a user to mouse over different colored squares thereby
      activating sounds and color changes. The
      <a class="whiLink" href="./proto2.html">second</a> is designed for the
      user to press a letter key on their keyboard to activate a different note.
      Both of these were tests of how much input can be used to imagine what the
      internet sounds like. There will be many more to come and I’m excited to
      share them with you. Until next time, enjoy yourselves.
    </p>
    <h3>Week 1: 8/27</h3>
    <div class="wrapper">
      <img class="spin" src="./assets/IMG_7389.JPG" width="100%" />
      <img src="./assets/IMG_7390.jpg" width="100%" />
      <img class="spin" src="./assets/IMG_7392.JPG" width="100%" />
    </div>
    <p class="slim">
      The first week of Thesis 1 started with a bang! Or more precisely with a
      storm, a brainstorm that is (there are going to be lots of puns). The
      images above are of the exercise I did in class which was a clustering
      exercise. I started with the question I want to address; What does the
      Internet sound like?. I then proceeded to unleash the catlike agility of
      my mind and come up with a stupefying number of great ideas. JKJKJK I
      struggle with brainstorming. This time was not so different from every
      other time I’ve tried a formal brainstorming activity.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      Well, that’s not quite true. There was one difference, I genuinely tried
      to not put any pressure on myself to come up with “good ideas”. I tried to
      have any idea at all, come one, come all. By doing this I was able to find
      a little bit of creative flow that often eludes me during brainstorming.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      The second exercise I found even more productive. I pretended that I was
      interviewing myself. I let my inner Barbra Walters loose on my internal
      creative monologue. Again, while I was asking myself questions about what
      the internet sounds like I committed to treating myself with respect. No
      matter how I responded I was under no circumstances to ridicule myself, or
      otherwise be unkind. When I committed to questioning myself with only
      goodwill I found the answers I gave were quite productive.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      What emerged from all of this was a clearer perspective on what I am
      interested in and how I might begin to approach it. I found my reasons for
      being interested in what the internet sounds like are not simply to raise
      awareness. I am interested in this topic so the internet can be a more
      fully immersive and interesting place to spend time. I still feel I have a
      long way to go in formulating this idea. I now know I am doing this to
      improve people’s experience of the internet, I need to think about what I
      feel is missing. Right now it seems like the place to start exploring is
      how we are largely unaware of the data that is flowing in and out of our
      computers when we surf the internet.
    </p>
    <div class="one">
      <img id="smaller" class="cent" src="./assets/vennDia.jpg" />
    </div>
    <p class="slim">
      Above is the venn diagram exercise I did at home. The three domains are:
      The sound of the internet, new kinds of magazine, and Internet
      essentialism (what can the internet do that other mediums cannot?). This
      exercise was a good followup to the in class exercises. I also wanted to
      practice brainstorming in my notebook. I won’t always have a lot of space
      and sticky notes to use so I wanted to find a process that would fit
      inside of a notebook I always carry.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      In the coming week I have two primary goals. The first is to explore more
      fully what I would like to address when it comes to understanding what the
      Internet could sound like. The second is two explore at least one other
      area of inquiry that is not part of wondering what the internet sounds
      like. I’m afraid of committing to one idea too soon.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      By the end of the coming week I would like to have a clearer idea of what
      part of the internet I am most interested in trying to sonify and one more
      domain to explore that interests me. To get a clearer idea of what part of
      the internet I would like to focus on giving sound to I need to research
      how data is flowing in and out of a computer when it is being used to
      explore the internet. I need to do more *fun* brainstorming to develop
      another viable domain of interest.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">Talk to you soon.</p>
    <h3>Week 2: 9/3</h3>
    <p class="slim">
      The question I built for myself was “How is an HTML cookie made?”. I asked
      this question because it is one way that could be used to imaginatively
      explore what the internet sounds like. I started the process as I always
      do when trying to create a digital object, with
      <a class="whiLink" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN</a>. It
      turns out the creation of a cookie is very straight forward. They are a
      very old component of the internet, therefor creating them is not too
      difficult.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      All one has to do to create a cookie is type “document.cookie =
      ‘cookie=chocoChip’”. Of course there are many other attributes that can
      and should be given to cookies. Since this was the first part of what I
      imagine to be a much longer exploration of cookies I felt like it was ok
      to start with something very simple. As I learned over the summer it is
      much better to start simple and add complexity.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      After creating two cookies I wanted to see if I could print them to the
      console. This is the first step I, and many other people writing code
      take, to make sure the code is working. After simply loging the cookies to
      the console I then created a button users could click to log the cookies
      to the console.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      The final step I took was to make the button display the cookies to the
      webpage rather than the console. I’ve loaded this experiment
      <a class="whiLink" href="cookies.html">here</a> and I’d love you to play
      with it. The reason I chose to manipulate the DOM as the last piece of
      added complexity is because if I can display the names of the cookies on a
      webpage then I think I can use tone.js to trigger sounds whenever cookies
      are downloaded from a website.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      My plan for research is two pronged. I need to learn more about the
      technical aspects of our interactions with the internet and how to make a
      piece that utilizes sound in a meaningful and beautiful way.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      To learn about the ways in which we interact with the internet and the
      ways it interacts with us I will be using MDN Web Docs. MDN Web Docs were
      created and maintained by Mozilla. They have documentation regarding
      nearly any piece of internet technology and are a great place to start.
      They also give good background history, providing a roadmap for further
      research.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      To learn about art pieces that fuse technology and senses other than sight
      I’ve bought a book that focuses on an art show that focused solely on
      these types of art works. The title of the book is Sensorium. By reading
      what the artists and curators have to say should point me towards other
      sources for research.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      One of the most important things for me to do is to continue making things
      about my research. This will give me frequent deadlines, and help me asses
      the productivity of my research.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      The five people I listed as potential letter recipients are:<br />
      Lou Montulli<br />
      David Moore<br />
      John Roach Bill & Melinda Gates<br />
      John Cage<br />
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      I wrote to Lou Montulli, one of the people instrumental in the creation of
      HTTP Cookies. You can find the letter
      <a class="whiLink" href="tLetter.html">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      I’m happy with the progress I’ve made this week. I began to learn about
      how to access the events happening on the internet that are happening in
      the background. I need to continue researching how these types of events
      work and how to create a program that would be triggered by them.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      For the coming week while continuing the practical type of research I’ve
      been doing I need to begin doing research into sound. I would like to find
      resources that speak about how it affects us emotionally and how we
      process sound in our everyday lives. By the end of the week I would like
      to have found at least three good academic resources for how we react to
      sound physiologically and emotionally. I would like to find at least two
      more resources to explore how sound is thought about in a musical context,
      where the overlap is found with sound and music. Of course I will continue
      to explore and experiment with internet technologies and how they operate
      to find interesting candidates for use in this project.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      To accomplish these goals I plan to use our libraries, and online academic
      resources, especially JStore. JStore is a great resource for finding a lot
      of writing about a topic starting to do more in-depth research based on
      those initial findings.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">Talk to you next week.</p>
    <h3>Week 3: 9/10</h3>
    <p class="slim">
      I feel pretty comfortable with the progress I am making as of right now. I
      am getting a clearer idea of what my process looks like and how to use it
      in productive ways. I also know that I can not think about my thesis
      constantly, I need to put it down for periods of time, if only for a day
      so my thoughts cans arrange themselves. Below is an approximate diagram of
      how my process works.
    </p>
    <div class="one">
      <img id="smaller" src="./assets/process.jpg" />
    </div>
    <p class="slim">
      The timeline for this project is done, and I have large and small
      milestones that I know I need to get to. I already have my overarching
      question: “What does the Internet sound like?”. I have a good
      understanding of the motivation and methodology I’m going to use to
      explore this question.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      Now that my question and methodology are fairly clear I am able to start
      really examining who my audience is. This week I will be settling on the
      two-three groups I see making up my audience. Once I have a very clear
      idea of who my audience is I will be able to think about the impact I want
      my thesis to have on them. Right now the very fuzzy definition of the
      groups I’m working for are internet users who are rather uncomfortable
      thinking about the underlying technology of the internet. The other group
      are the people who are making the ad tech devices that are surveilling
      internet users. I feel like there’s probably another audience group
      lurking on the periphery of my mind, this we’ll I figure out who that is.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      I will conduct at least one interview with a person I think of as an
      audience member to get a better idea of how they understand the internet
      and how it works. By doing these interviews it will help me understand how
      to make a piece that will be impactful. Even when making something that is
      more artistic I think it’s a great idea to get input from potential
      audience members.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      I collected quite a few pieces of writing that will inform my thinking
      about this project. A book called Sensorium will help inform my aesthetic
      questions, while Invisible Labor will give me an theoretical foundation
      for why it is important for people to know they are doing free labor for
      ad tech companies. I’ve requested two more titles for the library that I’m
      waiting to receive. These titles cover sound and how it affects humans
      psychologically.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      In the coming week I need to read through what I’ve collected and let it
      inform what I’m making. I will make a few more casual prototypes based on
      this reading and testing them with some of my class mates on D12. I’m also
      going to continuing learning about javascript cookies and who they are
      made/used.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      Until next week enjoy this last little bit of summer!
    </p>
    <h3>Week 4: 9/17</h3>
    <p class="slim">
      Ok, first the boring stuff. I was able to get quite a bit done this week.
      I’ve been able to gather a lot of research on my topic. Naturally I’m not
      done researching but I certainly have enough material to read for the next
      few weeks, and enough to support writing the paper and presentation that
      are due as part of my midterms.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      The research I’ve gathered is as follows: Invisible Labor by Marion Crain
      et al., The Sonification Handbook by Thomas Hermann et al., Rorschach
      Audio by Joe Banks, Sensorium edited by Caroline A. Jones, How Music Works
      by David Byrne, and Psychoacoustics: An Introduction by Paul Oomen. I
      would still like to gather more, but since there are other things I have
      to do I feel comfortable working through what I’ve got before diving
      deeper.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      I’ve also got two of the three Precedents I need. The first is Ingrid
      Burington’s writing about the infrastructure of the Internet for the
      Atlantic. The second is “Internet Machine” by Timo Arnall. I’m looking for
      one good precedent within the sound art field and I will have found it by
      the end of this week.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      I have two prototypes made and the final artifact I’m making as part of my
      midterm deliverables will not be another prototype. It will be a series of
      interviews with one person from each of the three groups I see as being my
      audience. What I need to do this week is come up with 8-10 good questions
      to ask. I would like to use the same questions for all three groups so I
      can get a better idea of what each of these groups could potentially get
      from this piece.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      Based on the answers I receive I will adjust my approach to this project.
      At the moment I see it taking shape as a browser extension. This way it
      will be accessible to the broadest possible group of users.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      I have a pretty clear idea of who the audience is for this piece. I see
      the audience as being composed of three distinct groups, non-technical
      users of the internet, technical users of the internet/those who work for
      tech companies, and other artists in the sound art field. I want each of
      these groups to take different things away from my piece.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      I primarily want non-technical users of the internet to understand that
      the there is much more going on underneath the surface of the internet
      than they are led to believe. Whenever they are using the Internet they
      are performing labor on behalf of the entities who are using the data
      transmitted to generate revenue.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      I want them to consider whether or not the services they get from these
      companies is worth surrendering so much of their personal data. I think
      when people are less aware of exactly how much data is collected about
      them it is easy for them to think that google’s search capabilities are a
      fair trade. When people find out how much money google makes using their
      data I believe many of them would re-evaluate how equitable this
      arrangement is. Google is also just one example, and they are certainly
      not even the most egregious offender.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      If people realize how valuable their personal data is to the ad tech
      industry I would hope they would start to ask for a more equitable
      arrangement. To be perfectly clear I do not consider the ad tech industry
      evil. I think it is mostly comprised of people who just need a job like
      the rest of us. I do believe it is an industry ripe for reform. This
      reform can only happen if ordinary Internet users are aware of just how
      valuable they are to the industry.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      I also want non-technical users to gain a better understanding of how the
      Internet actually works. I think many people in this group think of their
      browser as a kind of window into the Internet. Because they think of it as
      a window they do not realize that a lot is happening to give them this
      experience. Their computer is less like a window into another world and
      more like a car. If people had a better understanding of what was actually
      going on when they use the Internet they would use it in a manner that was
      both safer and more equitable for them.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      The second audience I see for my piece, which I will simply call Insiders
      for brevity’s sake, I want to hear how much their industry as a whole is
      taking advantage of the very people that are responsible for it
      flourishing. If users were to hold ad tech, and the tech industry in
      general, more accountable for their actions what would the industry look
      like? I imagine it would be a very different place.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      The third audience for this piece is other artists working in the sound
      space. This type of art is becoming more and more popular and I would
      certainly like to engage with this group when I leave school. This project
      will be a great way to start to engage with this section of the artistic
      community.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      This brings me to the more specific question I’ve been formulating for
      this project. My original question “What does the Internet sound like?” is
      still a great guiding question but certainly not specific enough for a
      thesis project that is supposed to be completed over the course of an
      academic year.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      With this project I am interested in focusing on “Why can’t we hear the
      background operations of the Internet? If we could hear some of these
      operations would our experience of the Internet change?”. My original
      question is a nice tag line to get people’s attention and this more
      specific question is getting close to a thesis statement for the paper I
      will be writing. Taken together I think I’m very close to having a final
      version of my question.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      We were asked to write an exploratory first draft of our essay. Here is s
      <a class="whiLink" href="essayDraft.html">link</a> to a mine.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      Just to recap for my own sanity, by the end of this week I need to have
      one more precedent. This one from the sound art field. My interview
      questions, and emails sent to people I would like to interview asking,
      nay, pleading, for their time.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      Sorry this was so long. I hope you enjoyed my wall of words.
