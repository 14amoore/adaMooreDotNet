    <h2>
      DrinkBot was created for two reasons. The first being a continuation of my
      earlier work creating Twitter bots. My first bot, launched two years ago,
      was called <a href="project2.html">BreadBot</a>.
    </h2>
    <h2>
      BreadBot was a simple twitter bot that tweeted out a type of bread from a
      list of breads from around the world. The list was taken from wikipedia.
      Because this project was done so long ago it was very rudimentary. In the
      time since BreadBot went live my abilities as a developer have grown and I
      wanted to challenge myself.
    </h2>
    <h2>
      The second reason for making DrinkBot was the fact that during quarantine
      no one in New York has been able to a bar until recently and, even now the
      experience is not one that many people feel comfortable with. The only
      solution is to make drinks at home. Unfortunately making a good drink
      isn't as easy at it seems. Bartending is a craft like any other, it takes
      practice and skill to make a drink properly.
    </h2>
    <h2>
      This is where DrinkBot comes in! Every day at 5pm eastern time it tweets
      out a new recipe. The recipes are taken from
      <a href="https://punchdrink.com/recipe-archives/"
        >Punch Magazine's recipe archive</a
      >. Punch does not have an API so I had to scrape recipes from their
      archive. Because Punch's recipe archive is an SPA,
      <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer">Puppeteer</a> was the
      best choice for this task. Puppeteer ‚Äúprovides a high-level API to control
      Chrome and Chromium over the DevTools Protocol.‚Äù. Puppeteer works
      perfectly to generate the pre-rendered content of Punch‚Äôs recipe archive.
    </h2>
    <h2>
      DrinkBot is deployed to a heroku server and runs using Node.js. Everyday
      at 5pm the program runs, sending a headless browser to Punch. When Punch‚Äôs
      recipe page is loaded the browser then goes to a page chosen at random.
      Once the random recipe page is loaded, the browser chooses a random recipe
      from that page, a link to the recipe, and downloads an image of the drink.
    </h2>
    <h2>
      Once all of the content is ready, using twitter as a database it compares
      the tweet that is ready to be sent against the tweets that have already
      been posted. If there is a match a new recipe is scraped until one is
      found that has not already been posted. This approached allowed me to
      streamline the process of keeping track of what recipes have already been
      posted. The other approach would have been to use a separate database,
      which would have dramatically increased the time needed to develop this
      Bot.

    <h2>I hope you enjoy the drinks as much as I enjoyed making DrinkBot.</h2>
