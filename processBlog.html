    <h3>Week 1: 5/13</h3>
    <p class="slim">
      The first week of my JS Independent Study will consist of a brief project
      that includes an editor, a lintor, and a formatter. The editor I chose to
      use is VS Code, the lintor is eslint, and the formatter is prettier. This
      project will also use typescript, sass, and pug.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      As of right now I'm still doing research on typescript, sass, and pug. I'm
      not sure exactly what it is I'd like to make but I'll work that out soon.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      After a lot of trial/error, not to mention some mistakes in what I chose
      to learn about first. I learned how to configure a linter, a formatter,
      and my code editor. To configure eslint I used airbnb's configs, I also
      used a prettier config for eslint that overrides any airbnb rules that do
      not have anything to do with code quality. Using two sets of configs makes
      it so there aren't conflicts between the linter, which is not very
      opinionated, and prettier, which is quite opinionated.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      TypeScript, sass, and pug will be very useful tools when working on bigger
      projects. Pug and Sass are both preprocessers. They allow developers to
      write more terse versions of html, and css respectively. PUG depends
      entirely upon whitespace for the formatting. Sass's syntax is reminiscent
      of JS, it also allows for the introduction of variables which are very
      useful in the increasingly complex stylesheets people are creating. PUG
      and sass utilize 'mixins' which are separate pieces of code that are
      reusable across projects. Mixins also seem like they would be very useful
      when working on commercial projects where it is very important to be
      precise with colors and typefaces.
    </p>

      You can see the very basic exercise I completed using SASS, PUG, and
      TypeScript <a href="week1.html">here</a>.

    <h3>Week 2: 6/6</h3>
    <p class="slim">
      This week was all about bundlers, with a little lodash sprinkled on top.
      There are many bundlers out there to choose from. The top three are
      Webpack, Grunt, and Gulp. Webpack leads in popularity by a wide margin
      according to
      <a href="https://2018.stateofjs.com/other-tools/">State of JS</a>.
      Bundlers are enormously powerful programs that can simplify very large
      projects and optimize them for deployment. Webpack even has different
      settings depending on if you're using it in development mode, or
      production mode. For small projects it's a bit too robust, the amount of
      node modules needed for it to work well are numerous. This is definitely
      something that would be very useful for ambitious professional projects.
      If you're interested in sketching this is way too much. I spent the better
      part of a day just getting all the configs set, and sending the bundled
      files to the proper places.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      Lodash was also involved in this week's exercise. Albeit only one
      function was called. Based on what I've read lodash is primarily used as a
      way to more quickly parse data and iterate over arrays. Because this
      project was mainly focused on the browser I wasn't able to really dig into
      the functionality of it. The most robust uses of lodash seem to happen
      when it is used in conjunction with node.js.
