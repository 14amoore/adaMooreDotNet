      This chrome extension uses HTTP cookies installed on user's computers by
      the websites they visit and
      <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/">Tone.js</a> to create a dynamically
      generated soundscape.
    </h2>
    <h2>
      "What are HTTP cookies? Why should I care about them? And what is a
      soundscape?" are all questions I expect you might have and I will do my
      best to answer them in brief. Should you want a much longer winded
      explanation please click <a href="thesisPaper.html">here</a> and you can
      read the written portion of my thesis in its entirety.

    <h2>
      HTTP cookies are one of the building blocks of the modern internet.
      Cookies come to us from a time when computing memory was much more
      expensive than it is today. They were used as a way to assist customers in
      keeping track of what was in their e-commerce shopping carts.
    </h2>
    <h2>
      Today the purpose of cookies has been almost completely inverted. Rather
      than helping people keep track of things they might like to buy, cookies
      have turned people into products tech companies might like to buy. The
      product sold is the data collected by cookies about user's browsing
      habits.
    </h2>
    <h2>
      As of now there is very little notification for users as to the purpose of
      the cookies being installed on their computers. The sheer number installed
      on a user's computer during an average browsing session can be staggering,
      with individual sites installing hundreds at a time. The aim of this
      extension is to use sound to alert users about the number, and some of the
      properties of the cookies being installed on user's computers.
    </h2>
    <h2>
      The soundscape created is tied to four different attributes of cookies.
      The lowest frequency is played for one second per cookie. The frequency of
      the percussive bass note is controlled by the security status, and domain
      associated with each cookie. The panning of the middle frequency is
      controlled by whether a cookie is a session cookie or not. Session cookies
      are panned to the right and non-session cookies are panned to the left.
      The highest note is controlled by the differnce between cookies that are
      short lived, and long lived. Cookies I considered to be short lived last
      on a user's computer for less than one week Cookies considered to be long
      lived remain longer than one week.
    </h2>
    <h2>
      If you would like to know more about the technical parameters of cookies
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies"
        >this</a
      >
      is an excellent place to start.
