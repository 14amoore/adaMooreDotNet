    <h3>Week 0: 8/24</h3>
    <p class="slim">
      Hi there! If you’ve made it all the way here I imagine you know my name,
      mostly because it is also part of the address for this website. If you’ve
      arrived here by tragic mistake my name is Adam Moore. I am in my second,
      and final year acquiring an MFA from the Design and Technology (henceforth
      referred to as D+T) program at Parsons.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      In my previous life I was a menswear designer at an American fashion brand
      that I decline to name. If you must have a hint I will tell you that the
      founder of the brand is from the Bronx, he is also incompetent, but that
      is a story for another time.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      I created this blog to document my process for my Thesis 1 class here at
      D+T. I am very much looking forward to sharing my failures, AND successes
      with anyone who happens to be reading this with any kind of regularity. I
      am interested in sound, color, shamanism, and the internet. I hope I can
      combine these interests in way that is meaningful to me, and entertaining,
      possibly illuminating to an outside audience (YOU! whoever you are).
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      This first post is three questions I cooked up for myself regarding how I
      might begin my Thesis one class. They are as follows:
    </p>
    <p class="slim">1.What does the internet sound like?</p>
    <p class="slim">
      2. How can we use web technologies to create an online publication that
      moves us (we, people, society) away from merely trying to emulate print?
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      3. What possible role can Shamanism play in the digital world?
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      I created two prototypes to explore question one (What does the internet
      sound like?). The <a href="./proto1.html">first</a> is designed for a user
      to mouse over different colored squares thereby activating sounds and
      color changes. The <a href="./proto2.html">second</a> is designed for the
      user to press a letter key on their keyboard to activate a different note.
      Both of these were tests of how much input can be used to imagine what the
      internet sounds like. There will be many more to come and I’m excited to
      share them with you. Until next time, enjoy yourselves.
    </p>

      The first week of Thesis 1 started with a bang! Or more precisely with a
      storm, a brainstorm that is (there are going to be lots of puns). The
      images above are of the exercise I did in class which was a clustering
      exercise. I started with the question I want to address; What does the
      Internet sound like?. I then proceeded to unleash the catlike agility of
      my mind and come up with a stupefying number of great ideas. JKJKJK I
      struggle with brainstorming. This time was not so different from every
      other time I’ve tried a formal brainstorming activity.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      Well, that’s not quite true. There was one difference, I genuinely tried
      to not put any pressure on myself to come up with “good ideas”. I tried to
      have any idea at all, come one, come all. By doing this I was able to find
      a little bit of creative flow that often eludes me during brainstorming.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      The second exercise I found even more productive. I pretended that I was
      interviewing myself. I let my inner Barbra Walter loose on my internal
      creative monologue. Again, while I was asking myself questions about what
      the internet sounds like I committed to treating myself with respect. No
      matter how I responded I was under no circumstances to ridicule myself, or
      otherwise be unkind. When I committed to questioning myself with only
      goodwill I found the answers I gave were quite productive.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      What emerged from all of this was a clearer perspective on what I am
      interested in and how I might begin to approach it. I found that my
      reasons for being interested in what the internet sounds like are not
      simply to raise awareness. I am interested in this topic so that the
      internet can be a more fully immersive and interesting place to spend
      time. I still feel I have a long way to go in formulating this idea. I now
      know I am doing this to improve people’s experience with the internet, I
      need to think about what I feel is missing. Right now it seems like the
      place to start exploring is how we are largely unaware of the data that is
      flowing in and out of our computers when we surf the internet.

      Above is the venn diagram exercise I did at home. The three domains are:
      The sound of the internet, new kinds of magazine, and Internet
      essentialism (what can the internet do what other mediums cannot?). This
      exercise was a good followup to the in class exercises. I also wanted to
      practice brainstorming in my notebook. I won’t always have a lot of space
      and sticky notes to use so I wanted to find a process that would fit
      inside of a notebook I always carry.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      In the coming week I have two primary goals. The first is to explore more
      fully what I would like to address when it comes to understanding what the
      Internet could sound like. The second is two explore at least one other
      area of inquiry that is not part of wondering what the internet sounds
      like. I’m afraid of committing to one idea too soon.
    </p>
    <p class="slim">
      By the end of the coming week I would like to have a clearer idea of what
      part of the internet I am most interested in trying to sonify and one more
      domain to explore that interests me. To get a clearer idea of what part of
      the internet I would like to focus on giving sound to I need to research
      how data is flowing in and out of a computer when it is being used to
      explore the internet. I need to do more *fun* brainstorming to develop
      another viable domain of interest.
